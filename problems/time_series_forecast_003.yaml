problem_statement: |
  Using the transaction data, build a time series forecasting model to predict daily sales.
  
  Your tasks:
  1. Aggregate transaction data to daily sales totals
  2. Explore time series patterns (trend, seasonality)
  3. Prepare data for forecasting (handle missing values, outliers)
  4. Build and evaluate forecasting models
  5. Generate 30-day forecast with confidence intervals
  6. Provide model performance metrics and business insights
  
  Expected deliverables:
  - Data preparation script (data_prep.py)
  - Time series analysis script (ts_analysis.py)
  - Forecasting model script (forecast_model.py)
  - Daily sales data (daily_sales.csv)
  - 30-day forecast (sales_forecast.csv)
  - Model evaluation report (forecast_report.md)

  - "data_prep.py"
  - "ts_analysis.py"
  - "forecast_model.py"
  - "daily_sales.csv"
  - "sales_forecast.csv"
  - "forecast_report.md"

scoring:
  correctness: 0.4
  methodology: 0.35
  code_quality: 0.15
  completeness: 0.1

hints:
  - "Aggregate transaction data by date to get daily sales"
  - "Check for missing dates and handle appropriately"
  - "Consider seasonal patterns (day of week, month effects)"
  - "Use appropriate forecasting methods (ARIMA, exponential smoothing)"
  - "Validate model performance using train/test split"

validation_criteria:
  - "Daily sales aggregation should be correct"
  - "Forecast should include confidence intervals"
  - "Model evaluation metrics should be included"
  - "Business interpretation should be meaningful"
