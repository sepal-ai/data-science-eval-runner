problem_statement: |
  Use the customer and transaction data to perform customer segmentation analysis.
  
  Your tasks:
  1. Create customer features from transaction data (RFM analysis)
     - Recency: Days since last purchase
     - Frequency: Number of transactions
     - Monetary: Total amount spent
  2. Add demographic features from customer data
  3. Perform clustering analysis to identify customer segments
  4. Analyze and interpret the segments
  5. Provide business recommendations
  
  Expected deliverables:
  - Feature engineering script (feature_engineering.py)
  - Clustering analysis script (clustering_analysis.py)
  - Customer segments data (customer_segments.csv)
  - Segment analysis report (segment_report.md)

expected_files:
  - "feature_engineering.py"
  - "clustering_analysis.py"
  - "customer_segments.csv"
  - "segment_report.md"

scoring:
  correctness: 0.35
  methodology: 0.35
  code_quality: 0.15
  completeness: 0.15

hints:
  - "Calculate RFM metrics by aggregating transaction data per customer"
  - "Consider normalizing features before clustering"
  - "Use appropriate clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical)"
  - "Validate your clusters and choose optimal number of segments"

validation_criteria:
  - "RFM features should be properly calculated"
  - "Clustering should produce meaningful segments"
  - "Customer segments CSV should include cluster assignments"
  - "Report should provide clear business insights"
