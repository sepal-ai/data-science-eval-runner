description: Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics
difficulty: medium
category: machine_learning
tags:
- segmentation
- clustering
- customer_behavior
problem_statement: "Use the customer and transaction data to perform customer segmentation\
  \ analysis.\n\nYour tasks:\n1. Create customer features from transaction data (RFM\
  \ analysis)\n   - Recency: Days since last purchase\n   - Frequency: Number of transactions\n\
  \   - Monetary: Total amount spent\n2. Add demographic features from customer data\n\
  3. Perform clustering analysis to identify customer segments\n4. Analyze and interpret\
  \ the segments\n5. Provide business recommendations\n\nExpected deliverables:\n\
  - Feature engineering script (feature_engineering.py)\n- Clustering analysis script\
  \ (clustering_analysis.py)\n- Customer segments data (customer_segments.csv)\n-\
  \ Segment analysis report (segment_report.md)\n"

scoring:
  correctness: 0.35
  methodology: 0.35
  code_quality: 0.15
  completeness: 0.15
hints:
- Calculate RFM metrics by aggregating transaction data per customer
- Consider normalizing features before clustering
- Use appropriate clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical)
- Validate your clusters and choose optimal number of segments
validation_criteria:
- RFM features should be properly calculated
- Clustering should produce meaningful segments
- Customer segments CSV should include cluster assignments
- Report should provide clear business insights
